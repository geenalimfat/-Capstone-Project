# Brainstorm
* Travel: A list of different food places/places to visit
    * Input a link to the place from google maps/any maps
    * Search bar that lets you look up the restaurant by name or key words from the restaurant description (i.e. seafood)
    * Can refine the list by type of food (ex. cuisine/type)
    * Can put pictures of the food that user has gotten at that restaurant/place for future reference
      * Can add any additional descriptions or notes
    * Can 'tick' off the restaurant once visited
    * Spin a wheel to help decide what you want to eat
        * refine with filer
    * Can share list with others 
        * give editing privileges 
    * Can create different lists:
      * ex. food, dessert, tourist spots, etc,.

* Cooking: Inventory and recipe manager
    * Input the main ingredients that are in the pantry, fridge, and freezer each grocery trip
        * Check off what's been used 
    * Input recipes and their ingredients 
        * Insert photos and notes 
    * Lists out what recipes that you can make with what's available 
    * Can rank the recipes that the user can make based on cook time 

* List: Upgraded list app that holds more information about what the user wants to buy
    * places that it can be bought at (ex. target, online, etc,.)
    * Input how much the item costs at each location
    * Can prioritize what needs to be bought
    * Can input more information about the item
        * what it's best used for
        * what user has heard about it
        * if user has bought it before, what they like/dislike about the product

* Entertainment/Social: Maps App that you can add your friends and they can post pictures of the place that they're at
    * Can friend people and see what they've been up to at the different places on the map
        * Can add the BeReal concept where it goes off once a day and people post what they're doing at that moment <-- would appear as a 'special' feature on the map to indocate
            * Can post whenever as well <-- can act as log for the users as well 
    * Private function if the user wants to log it for themselves but doesn't want to share with everyone
        * Can add notes/pictures about the place 


# Evaluated Ideas:

##  1. Travel: A list of different food places
* Mobile:
    * Links the **location** of the place the person wants to go to
        * maybe integrate a **map** to it/move into another maps app
    * **Camera**: Can add photos of the food/drinks that the user got there
* Story:
    * Friends with respond well to this product idea
        * Google Maps has the same concept where you can add places to the map, however, there's no way filter look up places from the list
            * problematic when the list gets too large
        * Can keep track of where users have visited + any additional notes and photos
    * Value(?): Organization
        * Does not necessarily have to apply to just food
        * Can have multiple lists
            * travel
            * tourist
            * food
* Market:
    * Potential User base: Foodies, Travellers, anyone who wants to keep track of certain location
        * can expand to include extended family/friends of the user if they want to share it
    * Provides values for foodies/travellers
        * People who save ideas of what to do/eat but cannot think of it in the moment
    * Value for indecisive eaters
        * Spin the wheel to help decide
* Habit:
    * Usage: on and off basis
        * whenever person wants to add a location
        * whenever a person is looking for a place to go to
        * Usage isn't necessarily daily
    * Average user creates on the app
        * Creates their own lists
        * adds their own photos/thoughts
* Scope:
    * Difficult if want to integrate a live map into the interface
        * Have to figure out how to filter
    * How to add in user's personal photos 
    * Stripped down version:
        * no map interface
        * no filteration system
            * Can only really search up the restaurant in mind
    * Clearly defined: Kind of


##  2. Cooking: Inventory
* Mobile: 
    * Not as unique 
    * Kind of like a glorified website
    * More portable
        * Can create grocery lists on the app(?)
        * If there is a recipe the user wants to make but does not have all the ingredients, app can create a list of what else the user needs
    * **Camera:** Can add photos of steps/ingredients/final product
* Story:
    * Value to those who struggle who don't know what to cook
    * People trying to cook more but struggle with organization
    * Peers/Students may like the idea since they don't know what to cook a lot of the time and they end up eating out because they don't know
        * Help with saving money
        
* Market:
    * Potential User base: Cooks/Bakers, People starting out to cook/bake, Foodies, Meal Preppers, Students, Regular households
    * Provides value for these users as it will help them save time and money, as well as help them better organize their pantry
    * Audience of the app is anyone whos frequently in the kitchen

* Habit: 
    * Not habit-forming or addictive
    * Usage-based
        * If the user is at the store looking for items to use 
        * If user is adding the newly bought item into their inventory
        * If user is looking for something to cook 
            * in the processing of using the recipe
        * If the user is checking what's in their inventory
    * Average User would idealy use it at least weekly or whenever they go to the store 
    * Mostly Consume the app once everything they've created is inputted
        * Inputting new things whenever grocery shopping or a new recipe
        * Inputting photos/notes when cooking

* Scope:
    * Not too technically challenging
        * Mimics the previous task apps
    * Stripped down version is the task app
    * Clearly Defined: Kind of (less than Travel)

## Final Idea:
* Travel App:
    * what need to figure out:
        * how to filter/find key words in restaurant description
        * how user will input the link to the place and clicking on it can take them to their maps app
            * If possible, integrate our own map onto the app
